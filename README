How to Compile cttex
--------------------
	You need an ANSI-C compiler, for example "gcc". SUN "cc" program
doesn't work.

	gcc -O2 -o cttex cttex.c

Description
-----------
	In short, "cttex" reads your "ttex" file (see example :- pentium.ttex)
and converts it into "tex" format which is understandable by "latex" command.
In detail, what "cttex" does is

	1. Scanning Thai sentences in your ttex file, and inserting
	   "WORD BREAK" special character to let TeX know where to break
	   a Thai sentence. "cttex" does this by using a dictionary based
	   algorithm. The dictionary file is "tdict.txt".

	2. Choosing appropriate WanNaYuk for better looking :- Lowering
	   Mai-Ek if Sara-I/E... is not there.

	3. Encoding Thai characters in "\cXXX" format conforming to
	   Manop's thai.sty file.

	4. Surrounding Thai sentences with {\thai ......} braces.

PS: If a number is given at command line, "cttex" will use that character
    as separating code and print out the result after step 1 without
    performing step 3 and 4. This is for verifying word-separating feature.
    For example,

		cttex 32 < pentium.ttex

    will print out "pentium.ttex" file with "space" separating Thai words.

By using "cttex" and Manop's ttex package, which is also included in this
package, the procedure of printing a Thai TeX file is

	1. Create your "ttex" file by any TIS Thai editors.
	   Don't worry about word separation.
	   (For example, pentium.ttex)

	2. Generate "tex" file by running

		cttex < pentium.ttex > pentium.tex

	3. Use ordinary latex (jlatex) command to generate "dvi" file

		jlatex pentium.tex

	   The program may complain that thai.sty is not available.
	   In which case, do the following to add current directory
	   into TeX search path, then try again.

		setenv TEXFONTS .:/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs

	4. Convert .dvi to .ps file by

		dvi2ps -R 400 -F ./tfontdesc pentium.dvi > pentium.ps

	   The number 400 is the resolution (DPI) of PS printer.

PS: These 4 steps are automatically performed in "dottex" shell script.

NOTE :
====
	1. Most of the files here are from Manop's ttex package at
	   ftp://rumi.cs.titech.ac.jp/pub/thai/

	2. The algorithm for choosing appropriate WanNaYuk was adopted
  	   from Rattipat's "tops" program available at the same ftp site.

	3. I got the dictionary file "tdict.txt" from Kitinon. No further
	   information where it emerged from.

	4. 6 Thai typefaces are defined in "thai.sty" file,

		\tlo		Loburi ordinary size
		\ltlo		Loburi large size
		\Ltlo		Loburi larger size

		\tpe		PeePee ordinary size
		\ltpe		PeePee large size
		\Ltpe		PeePee larger size

	   see "thai.sty", and you will know how to define more.
	   Use the \tfont command to select a typeface, for example

		\tfont{\tpe}	-> Select \tpe typeface

	5. The "ordinary size" is defined at 15pt (see thai.sty) which
	   matches (look good, I think) with 12pt of TeX roman font. So,
	   don't forget to add "12pt" in your \documentstyle command.

		If you prefer to use 10pt roman font, modify thai.sty
	   somehow to reduce size of Thai characters.

Example
-------
	There are 3 examples, in this package

		1. pentium.ttex
		2. testfont.ttex
		3. 941213

	- Run "dottex pentium" and you will obtain "pentium.ps" file.
	- Do the same for "testfont.ttex".  However, this file requires
	  "jarticle" style file. If you get an error message, try to install
	  it first.
	- 941213 is the typical News file from Thai News Agency obtainable
	  by subscribing to Yenbut's mailing list. First, you have to convert
	  it into "ttex" format. This can be done by using "news2ttex" perl
	  script.

		news2ttex 941213 > 941213.ttex

	  Then make PS file by

		dottex 941213.ttex
